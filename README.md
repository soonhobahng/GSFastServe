## GSFasetServe: FastAPI for Rapid API Development

GSFasetServe is a project created to simplify and expedite the process of building API servers using FastAPI. It provides a foundation upon which you can quickly construct and deploy your APIs.

**Key Benefits:**

* **Fast and Efficient Development:**  GSFasetServe streamlines the initial setup, allowing you to focus on core API functionalities.
* **Leverages FastAPI:**  Built upon the robust FastAPI framework, GSFasetServe inherits its strengths in performance and ease of use.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Clone or Download:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/soonhobahng/GSFastServe.git
   ```

2. **Edit routes.py:**
   ```python
    import os

    from fastapi import FastAPI, Request, Response
    from fastapi import Depends, APIRouter, UploadFile, File
    
    router = APIRouter()
    
    
    @router.get("/")
    async def home():
        return {"message": f"GSInsight FastServe!!!"}
   ```

   This example demonstrates a simple API that returns a JSON response for the root path (`/`).

**Further Exploration:**

Refer to the GSFasetServe documentation (to be added) for detailed instructions on utilizing its features to create comprehensive API functionalities. The documentation will cover aspects such as:

* Routing and request handling
* Data validation and schemas
* Dependency injection
* Error handling and middleware
